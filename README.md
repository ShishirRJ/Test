### 1. Project Title
Snake Game using Arduino Controlled by Joystick

### 2. Project Description
A classic Snake game implemented on Arduino, controlled with an analog joystick and displayed on an LED matrix. Keep track of your score on a 7-segment display, and enjoy sound effects with a Piezo Buzzer.

### 3. Devices Used
To bring this Snake Game to life, we've utilized the following components:

**LED Matrix (MAX7219)**: The game grid, snake, food, and obstacles are displayed here.

**Analog Joystick**: Control the snake's movements (up, down, left, right) with this.

**Piezo Buzzer**: Experience an opening and closing tune when you start and end the game.

**7-Segment Display (TM1637)**: Keep track of your score throughout the game.

**Potentiometer**: Adjust the game's difficulty by controlling the speed of the snake.

### 4. Wiring Diagram
|Device|Pin Number|
|---|---|
|Matrix CLK|5|
|Matrix CS|7|
|Matrix DIN|6|
|7 Segment Display DIO|11|
|7 Segment Display CLK|12|
|Piezo Buzzer|10|
|Joystick SW|2|
|Joystick X|A1|
|Joystic Y|A2|
|Potentiometer|A0|

### 5. Installation
**1. Hardware Setup:**
* Connect the LED Matrix (MAX7219) to your Arduino following manufacturer guidelines.
* Connect the Analog Joystick to your Arduino.
* Incorporate the Piezo Buzzer for sound effects.
* Display your score using the 7-Segment Display (TM1637).
* Use the Potentiometer to adjust the snake's speed.
**2. Software Setup:**
* Install the Arduino IDE if not already installed.
* Download the Snake Game code and upload it to your Arduino board.

### 6. How to Play
* Upon uploading the code to your Arduino, the game will begin, with an opening song played by the piezo buzzer.
* Use the joystick to guide the snake, collecting food represented as dots on the LED matrix.
* Each time the snake eats, it grows in length.
* Be cautious and avoid collisions with the wall or the snake's own body, as this will terminate the game.
* Your score is displayed on the 7-segment display.
* The game ends with a closing song played by the piezo buzzer when you lose. You can restart the game by resetting the Arduino or by pressing the button on the Analog Joystick.

### 7. Customization
Feel free to personalize this project by modifying the code. Adjust the game's rules, add new features, or change the visuals and sounds to suit your preferences.

### 8. Credits
**LedControl Library**: Credit goes to Eberhard Fahle for developing the LedControl library, which makes it easy to control LED matrices.

**TM1637 Library**: We would like to express our gratitude to Avishay for the TM1637 library, which simplifies the use of 7-segment displays.
